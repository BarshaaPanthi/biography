            National heroine: The first nepali women to climb Mount Everest.
          </h2>
          <p>
            <b>Pasang Lhamu Sherpa</b> was born on December 10, 1961, in the
            mountainous region of Nepal. She was raised in a mountaineering
            family. The society was male-dominant where men were given more
            priority than women. However, Pasang was against this domination
            since childhood and always wanted to prove that women are no less
            than men. Pasang was always fascinated by climbing mountains. With
            an equality mindset and a supportive family, she also started to
            climb mountains in her teenage years. Pasang Lhamu Sherpa is the
            first-ever woman to reach the highest peak of the world, Mt.
            Everest. Her courageous act of climbing Mount Everest is always
            respected in history. She never gave up on her dream of climbing the
            highest peak and her continuous efforts lead her to her success
            story. After the first conquest of Mount Everest by Tenzing Norgay
            Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953, the mountain was still
            untouched by any Nepali women. By 1993, only 16 women from different
            countries climbed the highest peak in the world. Despite the number
            of people climbing mt. Everest, no Nepali women had ever placed
            their foot on the mountain. This was because of the male dominant
            society that the people of Nepal lived in. Only men were allowed to
            climb the highest peak until a 31-year-old Pasang Lhamu Sherpa broke
            all stereotypes and accomplished what no other Nepali women ever
            could. Inspiring hundreds and thousands of women, the biography of
            Pasang Lhamu Sherpa is quite interesting.
